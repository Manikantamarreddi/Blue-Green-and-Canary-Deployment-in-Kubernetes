Consider you are Deploying a application as pods using Deployment in kubernetes. 
Note: Deployment manages ReplicaSets and ReplicaSets Manages Pods and Pod manages Containers internally.

Now due to our latest Deployment (New Change) many of the features Got Broken and this causes impact on end users. So you should immediately rollback to Previous Revision.
This is possible because we are using Deployment Controller to deploy our Pods.

To see the Revisions available for your deployment use command: kubectl rollout history deployment <deploymentName> -n <namespaceName>
 This gives different revisions of our deployment.
Now to see more information about a particualr revision like what Image it is using, what environment variables it is using you can execute below command
  kubectl rollout history deployment <deploymentName> --revision <revisionNumber> -n <namespaceName>
Now to rollback to Previous Revision if there are issues in current revision, you can use below command
  kubectl rollout undo deployment <deploymentName> -n <namespaceName>
  The above command rollbacks to last available Revision. Now if you want to rollback to Particular revison use below command.
   kubectl rollout undo deployment <deploymentName> --to-revision -n <namespaceName>
